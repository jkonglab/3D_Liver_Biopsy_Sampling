## MATLAB code

*  First step: Run imagepreprocessing.m for color deconvolution. This function will call labelimg.m and normalizeStaing.m
    1) imagepreprocessing.m: read image data and color deconvolution;
    
     Input: image file path; Put the source image into the  Folder: ProjectImgFile\imgsrc\
    
    2) labelimg.m
    
    3) normalizeStaing.m
    
    
    % read the image file; 
    
* Second step: calculating the fibrosis ratio and needle biopsy cross-section visualization.
   1) test.m: input the tube and tissue size parameters, point coordinate position.  
       Input: image file path, and tube parameters and penetration point.
